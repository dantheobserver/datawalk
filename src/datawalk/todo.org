* TODO change printing to protocol so that users can extend (see protocols branch)
** In progress, see `protocols` branch
* TODO printing keys -- if namespaced keyword & longer than max-line-length, take `name` before limiting
** At (limit-right (:max-key-length @config) k)
* TODO add example data (& instructions) - maybe with core/demo fn for ease
* TODO need some easy way to access state from core so users don't need to require multiple nss
* TODO automatically deref references?
* Commands:
** TODO split `c` into prn and pprint
** TODO do I possibly want a command to save current to a named var? (eg d)ef )
** TODO commands for find-key, find-val? g)rep
** TODO change certain commands to mnemonic symbols? I'm thinking < and > for backward/forward, maybe ^ for up.
** TODO consider: `t` for type
** TODO consider: map and/or filter commands
* TODO Find or build a way to generalize `read-line` across environments.
** @mfikes ABIO lib might help.
